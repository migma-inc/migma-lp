                company, unless such company is an official client, partner, or subcontracted
                affiliate of MIGMA and expressly authorized in writing. This restriction exists to
                prevent conflicts of interest, diversion of clients, and the misuse of confidential
                information acquired through MIGMA.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.2 The Contractor acknowledges that MIGMA will grant access to confidential
                operational methods, scripts, processes, artificial intelligence systems, CRM
                structures, and proprietary business strategies. Therefore, performing services for
                competing entities during the term of this Agreement constitutes a direct
                competitive conflict.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.3 After termination of this Agreement, the Contractor is free to work for any
                company in the immigration or visa industry, with no restriction, provided that the
                Contractor:
                <br />
                (a) does not use or reproduce MIGMA’s confidential information, documents, client
                lists, scripts, manuals, AI systems, workflows, training materials, or intellectual
                property;
                <br />
                (b) does not solicit, contact, divert, or attempt to divert any MIGMA clients,
                leads, prospects, employees, or partners for personal or third-party benefit;
                <br />
                (c) does not replicate or attempt to recreate MIGMA’s internal operational model,
                artificial intelligence environment, technological framework, or proprietary
                business methodology;
                <br />
                (d) does not establish a new business or entity that, intentionally or by structure,
                constitutes a reproduction or direct derivation of MIGMA’s business model or
                intellectual property.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.4 Any violation of this clause, whether during the term of the Agreement or after
                its termination, shall result in:
                <br />
                (i) liquidated damages in the amount of US$ 15,000.00 (fifteen thousand U.S.
                dollars), automatically due upon breach;
                <br />
                (ii) the right of MIGMA to pursue civil and criminal actions both in the United
                States (State of Arizona) and in the Contractor’s country of residence;
                <br />
                (iii) immediate termination of this Agreement, if still active, without prejudice to
                additional remedies.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.5 The obligations set forth in this clause survive termination of the Agreement
                for as long as necessary to protect MIGMA’s confidential information, intellectual
                property, technological assets, and economic interests.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.6 Nothing in this clause shall be interpreted as restricting the Contractor’s
                general freedom to work for competitors after the termination of this Agreement,
                provided the restrictions above are fully respected.
